I am a design engineer passionate about working with React and TypeScript. My interests lie in crafting and sharing design systems, implementing enterprise-level applications, and experimenting with playful components using TailwindCSS.

My recent experience was as a frontend design engineer at [Rocketium](https://rocketium.com), where I contributed to building Hydrogen, an internal design system powered by React, TypeScript, and [Mantine UI](https://mantine.dev). Hydrogen serves as a wrapper design system built with Mantine UI and custom components. I optimized components for faster rendering, introduced micro-interactions and animations using [Framer Motion](https://framer.com/motion), and participated in the Rocketium 2.0 project, redesigning enterprise-facing features and implementing a dynamic island feature to provide contextual suggestions across the platform.

I occasionally write and publish reusable components on my UI kit project, [Cookies](https://usecookies.vercel.app).

During my pre-final year of college, I interned at [GitHub](https://github.com/home) as an Engineering Intern. I developed an internal tool for generating QR codes for GitHub events and promotional content using [GitHub short URL](https://gh.io). This tool was built with React, TypeScript, and Fastify, and was secured via Okta. I also contributed to landing pages for internal tools and educational events, including [Octogatosconf](https://octogatosconf.com).

In previous internships and roles, I worked extensively on building design systems and reusable components, designing and implementing landing pages with a focus on design quality and accessibility, and leveraging TypeScript effectively for robust component development.

In my free time, I enjoy building side projects, creating intricate components, and documenting the engineering process on my [personal website](https://yashsehgal.com).
